# Project: Ray Tracing

This project was developed as part of the "GPU Computing" course for the Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Milan (Universit√† degli Studi di Milano). It aims to compare the performance of a naive CPU-based ray tracing algorithm with a highly parallelized version implemented on a GPU using CUDA.

## Features

- **CPU Implementation**: A straightforward, sequential version of the ray tracing algorithm.
- **GPU Implementation**: A highly parallelized version that leverages thousands of GPU threads to accelerate computations.
- **Project Report**: For a detailed explanation of the implementation, results, and analysis, please refer to the [project report](./report/report.pdf).

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **NVIDIA GPU**: A compatible NVIDIA GPU is necessary to run the GPU version of the ray tracing algorithm.
- **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit**: Ensure you have the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed, which includes the `nvcc` compiler required to compile CUDA code. You can download it from the [official NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- **Make**: A build automation tool like `make` is required to use the provided `Makefile` for building and running the project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andreal2000/Project-Ray-Tracing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Project-Ray-Tracing
   ```

3. Build and execute the project using make

## Usage

The project provides a `Makefile` to simplify the build and execution process. Below are the available commands and their descriptions:

- **Build CPU version**:  
  Compiles the CPU-based implementation of the ray tracing algorithm.  

  ```bash
  make cpu
  ```

- **Build GPU version**:  
  Compiles the CUDA-based implementation of the ray tracing algorithm.  

  ```bash
  make gpu
  ```

- **Run CPU version**:  
  Compiles and runs the CPU-based version.  

  ```bash
  make cpu-run
  ```

- **Run GPU version**:  
  Compiles and runs the CUDA-based version.  

  ```bash
  make gpu-run
  ```

- **Sanitize GPU version**:  
  Compiles and runs the GPU version with CUDA compute sanitizer to detect memory leaks and race conditions.  

  ```bash
  make gpu-sanitize
  ```

- **Clean build artifacts**:  
  Removes the compiled binaries and other generated files.  

  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
